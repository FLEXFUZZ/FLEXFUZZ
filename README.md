## FLEXFUZZ
FLEXFUZZ is a parallel fuzzing system that dynamically allocates tasks based on boundary basic blocks, optimizing exploration by adapting to runtime performance. A multi-objective, distance-guided approach further refines task allocation, enhancing vulnerability detection and coverage. This repository includes the analysis scripts used in FLEXFUZZ. We are conducting a phased internal review to ensure compliance with internal and regulatory standards. The code will be released in stages to make it fully available soon. We appreciate the community's patience and understanding throughout this process.
